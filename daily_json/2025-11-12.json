        "summary": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been explored widely for 3D scene understanding. Among them, training-free approaches are gaining attention for their flexibility and generalization over training-based methods. However, they typically struggle with accuracy and efficiency in practical deployment. To address the problems, we propose Sparse3DPR, a novel training-free framework for open-ended scene understanding, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs and requires only sparse-view RGB inputs. Specifically, we introduce a hierarchical plane-enhanced scene graph that supports open vocabulary and adopts dominant planar structures as spatial anchors, which enables clearer reasoning chains and more reliable high-level inferences. Furthermore, we design a task-adaptive subgraph extraction method to filter query-irrelevant information dynamically, reducing contextual noise and improving 3D scene reasoning efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of Sparse3DPR, which achieves a 28.7% EM@1 improvement and a 78.2% speedup compared with ConceptGraphs on the Space3D-Bench. Moreover, Sparse3DPR obtains comparable performance to training-based methods on ScanQA, with additional real-world experiments confirming its robustness and generalization capability.",

        "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language tasks, but they continue to struggle with spatial understanding. Existing spatial MLLMs often rely on explicit 3D inputs or architecture-specific modifications, and remain constrained by large-scale datasets or sparse supervision. To address these limitations, we introduce SpatialThinker, a 3D-aware MLLM trained with RL to integrate structured spatial grounding with multi-step reasoning. The model simulates human-like spatial perception by constructing a scene graph of task-relevant objects and spatial relations, and reasoning towards an answer via dense spatial rewards. SpatialThinker consists of two key contributions: (1) a data synthesis pipeline that generates STVQA-7K, a high-quality spatial VQA dataset, and (2) online RL with a multi-objective dense spatial reward enforcing spatial grounding. SpatialThinker-7B outperforms supervised fine-tuning and the sparse RL baseline on spatial understanding and real-world VQA benchmarks, nearly doubling the base-model gain compared to sparse RL, and surpassing GPT-4o. These results showcase the effectiveness of combining spatial supervision with reward-aligned reasoning in enabling robust 3D spatial understanding with limited data and advancing MLLMs towards human-level visual reasoning.",

        "summary": "LiDAR super-resolution addresses the challenge of achieving high-quality 3D perception from cost-effective, low-resolution sensors. While recent transformer-based approaches like TULIP show promise, they remain limited to spatial-domain processing with restricted receptive fields. We introduce FLASH (Frequency-aware LiDAR Adaptive Super-resolution with Hierarchical fusion), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations through dual-domain processing. FLASH integrates two key innovations: (i) Frequency-Aware Window Attention that combines local spatial attention with global frequency-domain analysis via FFT, capturing both fine-grained geometry and periodic scanning patterns at log-linear complexity. (ii) Adaptive Multi-Scale Fusion that replaces conventional skip connections with learned position-specific feature aggregation, enhanced by CBAM attention for dynamic feature selection. Extensive experiments on KITTI demonstrate that FLASH achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics, surpassing even uncertainty-enhanced baselines that require multiple forward passes. Notably, FLASH outperforms TULIP with Monte Carlo Dropout while maintaining single-pass efficiency, which enables real-time deployment. The consistent superiority across all distance ranges validates that our dual-domain approach effectively handles uncertainty through architectural design rather than computationally expensive stochastic inference, making it practical for autonomous systems.",

        "summary": "Modern autonomous driving (AD) systems leverage 3D object detection to perceive foreground objects in 3D environments for subsequent prediction and planning. Visual 3D detection based on RGB cameras provides a cost-effective solution compared to the LiDAR paradigm. While achieving promising detection accuracy, current deep neural network-based models remain highly susceptible to adversarial examples. The underlying safety concerns motivate us to investigate realistic adversarial attacks in AD scenarios. Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of placing adversarial posters on the road surface to induce hallucinations in the detector. However, the unnatural appearance of the posters makes them easily noticeable by humans, and their fixed content can be readily targeted and defended. To address these limitations, we propose the AdvRoad to generate diverse road-style adversarial posters. The adversaries have naturalistic appearances resembling the road surface while compromising the detector to perceive non-existent objects at the attack locations. We employ a two-stage approach, termed Road-Style Adversary Generation and Scenario-Associated Adaptation, to maximize the attack effectiveness on the input scene while ensuring the natural appearance of the poster, allowing the attack to be carried out stealthily without drawing human attention. Extensive experiments show that AdvRoad generalizes well to different detectors, scenes, and spoofing locations. Moreover, physical attacks further demonstrate the practical threats in real-world environments.",

        "summary": "Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving, enabling voxelized 3D scene understanding for effective scene perception and decision-making. Existing SSC methods have shown efficacy in improving 3D scene representations, but suffer from the inherent input-output dimension gap and annotation-reality density gap, where the 2D planner view from input images with sparse annotated labels leads to inferior prediction of real-world dense occupancy with a 3D stereoscopic view. In light of this, we propose the corresponding High-Dimension High-Density Semantic Scene Completion (HD$^2$-SSC) framework with expanded pixel semantics and refined voxel occupancies. To bridge the dimension gap, a High-dimension Semantic Decoupling module is designed to expand 2D image features along a pseudo third dimension, decoupling coarse pixel semantics from occlusions, and then identify focal regions with fine semantics to enrich image features. To mitigate the density gap, a High-density Occupancy Refinement module is devised with a \"detect-and-refine\" architecture to leverage contextual geometric and semantic structures for enhanced semantic density with the completion of missing voxels and correction of erroneous ones. Extensive experiments and analyses on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets validate the effectiveness of our HD$^2$-SSC framework.",

We present EAGLE, a novel framework that leverages episodic appearance- and geometry-aware memory to achieve unified 2D-3D visual query localization in egocentric vision. Inspired by avian memory consolidation, EAGLE synergistically integrates segmentation guided by an appearance-aware meta-learning memory (AMM), with tracking driven by a geometry-aware localization memory (GLM). This memory consolidation mechanism, through structured appearance and geometry memory banks, stores high-confidence retrieval samples, effectively supporting both long- and short-term modeling of target appearance variations. This enables precise contour delineation with robust spatial discrimination, leading to significantly improved retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, by integrating the VQL-2D output with a visual geometry grounded Transformer (VGGT), we achieve a efficient unification of 2D and 3D tasks, enabling rapid and accurate back-projection into 3D space.

        "summary": "Unsupervised domain adaptation for LiDAR-based 3D object detection (3D UDA) based on the teacher-student architecture with pseudo labels has achieved notable improvements in recent years. Although it is quite popular to collect point clouds and images simultaneously, little attention has been paid to the usefulness of image data in 3D UDA when training the models. In this paper, we propose an approach named MMAssist that improves the performance of 3D UDA with multi-modal assistance. A method is designed to align 3D features between the source domain and the target domain by using image and text features as bridges. More specifically, we project the ground truth labels or pseudo labels to the images to get a set of 2D bounding boxes. For each 2D box, we extract its image feature from a pre-trained vision backbone. A large vision-language model (LVLM) is adopted to extract the box's text description, and a pre-trained text encoder is used to obtain its text feature. During the training of the model in the source domain and the student model in the target domain, we align the 3D features of the predicted boxes with their corresponding image and text features, and the 3D features and the aligned features are fused with learned weights for the final prediction. The features between the student branch and the teacher branch in the target domain are aligned as well. To enhance the pseudo labels, we use an off-the-shelf 2D object detector to generate 2D bounding boxes from images and estimate their corresponding 3D boxes with the aid of point cloud, and these 3D boxes are combined with the pseudo labels generated by the teacher model. Experimental results show that our approach achieves promising performance compared with state-of-the-art methods in three domain adaptation tasks on three popular 3D object detection datasets.

These constraints cause a lack of geometric cues and reduced accuracy in occluded or truncated scenes. While recent approaches incorporate additional depth information to address geometric ambiguity, they overlook the visual cues crucial for robust recognition. We propose MonoCLUE, which enhances monocular 3D detection by leveraging both local clustering and generalized scene memory of visual features. First, we perform K-means clustering on visual features to capture distinct object-level appearance parts (e.g., bonnet, car roof), improving detection of partially visible objects. The clustered features are propagated across regions to capture objects with similar appearances. Second, we construct a generalized scene memory by aggregating clustered features across images, providing consistent representations that generalize across scenes. This improves object-level feature consistency, enabling stable detection across varying environments. Lastly, we integrate both local cluster features and generalized scene memory into object queries, guiding attention toward informative regions. Exploiting a unified local clustering and generalized scene memory strategy, MonoCLUE enables robust monocular 3D detection under occlusion and limited visibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark.",

Existing methods typically build networks on top of 2D visual backbones and depend heavily on labeled data for training, which is often scarce in real-world scenarios, causing a sim-to-real gap. Moreover, these approaches reduce the 3D-based problem to 2D domain, neglecting the 3D priors. To address these, we propose Robot Topological Alignment Graph (RoboTAG), which incorporates a 3D branch to inject 3D priors while enabling co-evolution of the 2D and 3D representations, alleviating the reliance on labels. Specifically, the RoboTAG consists of a 3D branch and a 2D branch, where nodes represent the states of the camera and robot system, and edges capture the dependencies between these variables or denote alignments between them. Closed loops are then defined in the graph, on which a consistency supervision across branches can be applied. This design allows us to utilize in-the-wild images as training data without annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is effective across robot types, highlighting its potential to alleviate the data bottleneck in robotics.",

        "summary": "Can we turn a video prediction model into a robot policy? Videos, including those of humans or teleoperated robots, capture rich physical interactions. However, most of them lack labeled actions, which limits their use in robot learning. We present Video Prediction for Robot Actions (ViPRA), a simple pretraining-finetuning framework that learns continuous robot control from these actionless videos. Instead of directly predicting actions, we train a video-language model to predict both future visual observations and motion-centric latent actions, which serve as intermediate representations of scene dynamics. We train these latent actions using perceptual losses and optical flow consistency to ensure they reflect physically grounded behavior. For downstream control, we introduce a chunked flow matching decoder that maps latent actions to robot-specific continuous action sequences, using only 100 to 200 teleoperated demonstrations. This approach avoids expensive action annotation, supports generalization across embodiments, and enables smooth, high-frequency continuous control upto 22 Hz via chunked action decoding. Unlike prior latent action works that treat pretraining as autoregressive policy learning, explicitly models both what changes and how. Our method outperforms strong baselines, with a 16% gain on the SIMPLER benchmark and a 13% improvement across real world manipulation tasks.

        "title": "An Image-Based Path Planning Algorithm Using a UAV Equipped with Stereo Vision",
        "summary": "This paper presents a novel image-based path planning algorithm that was developed using computer vision techniques, as well as its comparative analysis with well-known deterministic and probabilistic algorithms, namely A* and Probabilistic Road Map algorithm (PRM). The terrain depth has a significant impact on the calculated path safety. The craters and hills on the surface cannot be distinguished in a two-dimensional image. The proposed method uses a disparity map of the terrain that is generated by using a UAV. Several computer vision techniques, including edge, line and corner detection methods, as well as the stereo depth reconstruction technique, are applied to the captured images and the found disparity map is used to define candidate way-points of the trajectory. The initial and desired points are detected automatically using ArUco marker pose estimation and circle detection techniques. After presenting the mathematical model and vision techniques, the developed algorithm is compared with well-known algorithms on different virtual scenes created in the V-REP simulation program and a physical setup created in a laboratory environment. Results are promising and demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",
